    <sys:String x:Key="Title">Final Years</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text1">"Plaudite amici, comoedia finita est." Illness, financial scarcity, and concerns about his nephew marked Beethoven's last years. Despite everything, as after the "Heiligenstadt Testament," he gathered all his artistic energies and created his final works: the "Missa Solemnis," the last piano sonatas, the final quartets, and the 9th Symphony. The final acceptance of "Fidelio" encouraged him again in 1823 to plan an opera. It was to be "Melusine," by Franz Grillparzer, with whom he had already discussed the matter. But there was no time for that.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text2">In the autumn of 1826, Beethoven spent a few weeks at the Gneixendorf estate, which his brother had bought. He suffered from liver cirrhosis and ascites, and on December 2, during the return journey to Vienna (in an open carriage), he contracted pneumonia. He recovered a little and, on January 3, 1827, wrote his will. He knew the end was near. Among his last visitors were Hummel, Kreutzer, and the young Franz Schubert. On March 23, he dictated his final will: "My nephew Karl will be my sole heir. The capital of my inheritance, however, must go to his natural or testamentary heirs." The following day, Beethoven received the last rites and passed away on the afternoon of March 26, during a storm.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text3">On March 29, twenty thousand people attended his funeral at the Währing cemetery. The blessing ceremony was held at the parish church of Alservorstadt, where eight chapel masters held the shroud and several musicians carried torches on either side, including Schubert. During the burial at the Währing cemetery, talking was prohibited; the funeral oration, written by Grillparzer, was recited at the entrance by the actor Anschütz.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text4">On June 21, 1888, Beethoven's remains were moved to the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) and interred in an honorary grave. Despite all the successes of that year, it should not be forgotten that Beethoven was becoming increasingly deaf until, by 1818, he could hear nothing at all.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text5">Gerhard von Breuning spoke about his visit to Beethoven:</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text6">"That day, as many times before, I found him sleeping when I arrived. I sat by the bedside, trying not to make noise so as not to wake him from his sleep (hoping it was restorative) and skimmed through and read the unfinished conversation notebooks on the nightstand to find out who had been here and what had been discussed. I found, among other things, this note: 'Your quartet, performed yesterday by Schuppanzigh, was not liked.' When he woke up a little later, I showed him this passage, asking what he thought: 'They will like it someday,' he replied tersely; and added with conviction and declared peremptorily that he wrote as he judged and did not let himself be misled by the opinions of his contemporaries. He added: 'I know I am an artist'." [Breuning, op. cit. P. 142 et seq.]</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text7">He composed the "Hammerklavier" Sonata, the "Missa Solemnis," and the 9th Symphony. On March 19, 1823, Archduke Rudolf received the "Missa Solemnis," about which Beethoven had written: "From the heart - may it return to the heart." With it, he wanted to awaken lasting religious feelings among the singers and listeners, and he himself had delved into God and religiosity as an individual during the work on this piece, but not in the institution of the church. The "Missa Solemnis" is not music for masses but the expression of the deep religiosity of the artist and man Beethoven.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text8">The 9th Symphony premiered on May 7, 1824, conducted by Beethoven as a formality, but he could no longer hear the applause of the audience. The earnings were also disappointingly low.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text9">While Beethoven constantly paved new ways in the field of composition, his life turned without external events along increasingly miserable paths and was marked by illness, loneliness, financial problems, and disputes over his nephew. In March 1827, Ferdinand Hiller visited the ailing Beethoven with Hummel and his wife:</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text10">"... Now he seemed to regret not having married. Even on our first visit, he had joked about this with Hummel... 'You,' he said laughing, 'you are a lucky man; you have a wife who cares for you, who loves you, but I, wretched me!' and he gave a deep sigh." [Benyovszky, K. "J. N. Hummel, der Mensch und Künstler" Bratislava: 1934. P. 151 et seq.]</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text11">Beethoven, who suffered from liver cirrhosis and ascites, contracted pneumonia due to the hypothermia suffered during the journey in an open wagon from Gneixendorf to Vienna in December (!) 1826. After recovering a bit, he passed away on March 26, 1827, in Vienna. A large number of people attended the funeral at the Währing cemetery on March 29. None other than Franz Grillparzer wrote the "eulogy at Beethoven's grave," which was recited by actor Anschütz at the entrance to the cemetery.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text12">"We, who are here in front of the tomb of the deceased, are in a way the representatives of a whole nation, of all the German people, and we are here to mourn the loss of a highly acclaimed part of what remains of the lost brilliance of our national art, of the spiritual flourishing of our homeland. The hero of German-language poetry still lives, and may he live much longer... But the last master of sound, the exquisite mouth of music, the man who inherited and expanded the immortal fame of Handel and Bach, Haydn and Mozart, has ceased to live, and we are here weeping, in front of the broken strings of an instrument now silenced... He was an artist, but he was also a man. A man in every way and in the highest sense of the word. Because he withdrew from the world, he was called a misanthrope, and because he remained indifferent to sentimentality, he was called insensitive... And when, throughout your lives, the power of his work breaks upon you like a storm, when your joy flows in the midst of a generation yet unborn, then remember this moment and think: we were there when they buried him, and when he died, we mourned."</sys:String>
