    <sys:String x:Key="Title">Heiligenstadt Testament</sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text1">"I want to seize fate by the throat; it certainly will not completely defeat me."
    [Beethoven's letter to Wegeler, November 16, 1801]
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text2">As early as 1794-1796, Beethoven noticed the first symptoms of a hearing disorder that would progressively worsen, eventually leaving him completely deaf in 1819.
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text3">In the summer of 1796, Beethoven was gravely ill, though not from typhus, as he had been on some occasions, but from a highly febrile viral or bacterial meningitis. Additionally, Beethoven suffered from a serious intestinal illness that caused him frequent colic.
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text4">Beethoven kept his hearing loss a secret, even from his closest friends. He probably feared it would affect his progress and professional career, though he also seemed to hope it was only temporary and would improve. It wasn’t until 1801, when he was certain that his deafness was progressive, that he confided his secret to others. There is a letter from June 1, 1801, addressed to the violinist Karl Amenda (to whom he dedicated his string quartet op. 18), in which Beethoven wrote:
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text5">"... you must know that my most precious faculty, my hearing, has greatly deteriorated; even when you were here, I felt discomfort and kept it silent, but now it’s becoming more serious; I don’t know if I’m still in time to heal, maybe it’s related to my stomach issues, which have almost completely resolved; I hope my hearing will also improve, though I doubt it, as these ailments are the most incurable... I beg you to keep my hearing problems a secret and not to mention it to anyone, no matter who."
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text6">On June 29, 1801, Beethoven wrote to his childhood friend from Bonn, Wegeler:
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text7">"... You want to know something about my situation; well, it's not all bad... my compositions bring me much... for each work, if it interests me, I have six or seven publishers, even more... but a jealous demon, my poor health, has crossed my path: for three years, my hearing has been growing weaker. This must come from my intestinal illness, which I had before, as you know, but has worsened a lot, as I am continually troubled by diarrhea and, consequently, very weak."
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text8">Beethoven wrote more about different therapeutic methods and, finally, about Vering (who also treated Schubert):
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text9">He managed to almost completely stop the severe diarrhea... but my ears are constantly ringing, day and night. I live a miserable life; for two years, I have avoided any company because I cannot say to people: I am deaf... To give you an idea of this strange deafness, I'll tell you that in the theater, I must sit near the orchestra to hear the actors. I don’t hear the high tones of instruments and voices when I’m a bit far away; in conversations, it's surprising that there are people who haven’t noticed it, as I often get confused. When they speak softly, I hardly hear; I hear sounds, but not words, and on the other hand, it is unbearable when they shout. What will happen next, only heaven knows... I have often cursed the Creator and my existence... If I can, I want to face my fate, and yet there will be moments in my life when I will be the most miserable creature of God..."
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text10">From these touching letters (and there are more), one can judge how desperate Beethoven was, as he always tried to hide from those around him that he was losing more and more of his hearing. But his peculiar idiosyncrasies cannot be justified by this alone.
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text11">"The fundamental cause of his excessive irritability, his aggressiveness, and his authoritarian character, which bordered on arrogance, could be found in the inconceivable intensity of his way of working. He tried to dominate his world of ideas through extreme concentration and aimed to expand his creative ideas to the fullest with the effort of a giant. Such an anguished and exhausting way of working must have inevitably kept his brain and nervous system in a state of continuous tension to the limit of what was possible. This constant striving for improvement, often unattainable, was also evident in the fact that he frequently held back compositions that had been commissioned for an unnecessary period of time without concern for agreed delivery deadlines."
[Anton Neumayr, "Musik und Medizin 1" ("Music and Medicine 1"). Vienna: 1992. p. 133.]

    <sys:String x:Key="Text12">In the summer of 1802, Beethoven's depression reached its first lowest point. On October 6 and 10, he wrote the "Heiligenstadt Testament," addressed to his brothers Kaspar Karl and Nikolaus Johann. [Full text at level 3]. After writing it, a change seemed to emerge as, after confiding, after venting his torment from the soul, and perhaps having given up hope that his illness would ever improve, Beethoven began a prolific creative period with renewed energy. He wrote the cheerful Symphony No. 2 and, the following year, the "Eroica," "Fidelio," and numerous great sonatas (the "Kreutzer Sonata" in 1803 and the "Waldstein" and "Appassionata" sonatas in 1804).
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text13">By putting into writing his complete depression and despair about his state of life and, above all, about his illness in the so-called "Heiligenstadt Testament" in October 1802, Beethoven also lifted this burden from his soul. Putting his deepest despair on paper visibly helped him overcome it, as demonstrated by the rich creative period that followed. Even within this "testament," a change occurs, almost a purification: at first, it is a justification for his grumpy and difficult character, which made it hard to get along with him; later, he expresses the misfortune of being unable to socialize; finally, these dark thoughts give way to love and care for his close ones. He wishes them a happy and fulfilling life, and thus he prepares himself for death. In this human development lies the true greatness of Beethoven's character.
    "To my brothers Carl and ... Beethoven"
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text14">Oh, men who judge me as malevolent, stubborn, or misanthropic! How wrong you are! Since my childhood, my heart and mind were inclined towards the tender feeling of kindness, and I was even willing to perform generous acts, but consider that it has now been six years since I have been attacked by an incurable ailment, aggravated by senseless doctors, deceived year after year with the hope of recovery, and finally forced to face the prospect of a lasting condition (whose cure will take years, or may even be impossible); born with a fiery and lively temperament, even susceptible to the distractions of society, I soon had to isolate myself and live my life in solitude; when at some point I tried to overcome the situation, oh, how harshly I was forced to recognize the then doubly real truth of my deafness, and even then, it was impossible for me to say to people: speak louder, shout!, because I am deaf. Ah! How could I admit such weakness in a sense that in me should be more perfect than in others, a sense that I once possessed in the highest perfection, a perfection such as few in my profession enjoy or have enjoyed."
